        This article discusses the order of technological advances during the
        digital revolution of typography. In 1985, Apple’s LaserWriter printer
        was developed, and to showcase the capabilities, Apple developed page
        layout applications in collaboration with software companies. This led
        to the start of digital typography design. The digital construction of
        letterforms began in the early 80s, and in 1986 Lucida was introduced to
        suit printing and screen display. Chicago and Geneva are typefaces
        developed to suit the need of the early mac’s system. Graphic designers
        started to digitalize their designs starting in 1985, designing
        typefaces that exploited the look of a pixel and creating a magazine to
        showcase these fonts. Antialiasing - blurring the edge of a letter into
        the background - was introduced in 1987, and later used in Photoshop.
        Adobe’s Photoshop and Illustrator, a photo retouching and drawing tool
        that supported the PostScript printer, was later introduced. Due to the
        introduction of the CD, graphic design now has to cover multimedia
        platforms, and there was a large need for digital fonts. Apple and Adobe
        quickly became the two heads of designing and digitalizing typefaces.
        After the prevalence of the CD-ROM market, the World Wide Web was
        introduced in the mid1990s, and more complex typographic choices were
        required for graphic designers. Designers saved their typefaces as
        graphic files using Photoshop due to the option to override the
        designer’s specifications in early HTML. Designers were allowed to
        conceptualize and realize letters in refreshing ways due to advancements
        in technology, and it revised the status of the written word in the late
        20th century.
