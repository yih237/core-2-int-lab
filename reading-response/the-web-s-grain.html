                    Frank Chimero mentions his experiences and long history with the internet, how he is overwhelmed by
                    the progression of the internet, and how many websites work against the web’s natural character -
                    “bicycle bear websites” - and used Apple’s website as an example of extra. He mentioned that Apple
                    is forcing too much on the web design, which is unnecessary. I went back to look at Apple’s website,
                    and all the animations and transitions look futuristic but make me feel dizzy. I looked at apple’s
                    website from my gaming monitor’s screen, and the combination of a Windows system and 1080p screen
                    showed drags under pictures, and the animated website did not flow smoothly. Going back to the
                    article, Chimero then mentioned that the designed websites on the internet are mainly the same due
                    to the regulations and restrictions of web design, as well as the requirements of clients and the
                    difference in viewports of the audience. I love how Chimero then proposed to stop“treating the web
                    like a blank canvas to paint on, and instead like a material to build with.” He then brings up David
                    Hockney, a relevant and renowned artist/ photographer/ printer that contributed generously to
                    contemporary art. David experimented with photographic joiners - photographs of space in different
                    directions put together as a grid to show the entire space - at first, and then slowly moved on from
                    square Polaroids with equal spacing to overlapping many photos creating works with edgeless
                    properties to tell a story. Chimero got inspired by David’s joiners and integrated them into his web
                    design. I think that what we can take from this is that we should look to art and other areas of
                    study to inform our design when we don’t have inspiration, and we feel lost.
