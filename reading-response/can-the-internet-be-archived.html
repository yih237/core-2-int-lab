                <p>"Black Gooey Universe" by Rashid Johnson examines identity and materiality. Johnson uses shea butter
                    and black soap to get people to think about how the things around us affect our bodies and our sense
                    of who we are. The installation challenges our assumptions about art materials and makes us think
                    about culture, race, and history.
                </p><br>
                <p>The installation is physically impressive. The vast, room-sized structure of many different materials
                    draws people in and makes them want to explore and interact. The installation compels the audience
                    to touch, smell, and interact with the objects. This physical contact with the art reminds us that
                    our identities are tied to our bodies and shows how our senses and physical experiences shape how we
                    see the world. It makes us think about our bodies and experiences in a deeply personal and universal
                    way. Johnson makes a space for people to think and reflect by asking them to use their senses and
                    personal experiences to interact with his art. He also encourages us to learn more about the rich
                    and complicated histories that have shaped our world. Through its use of tactile, sensory materials
                    and its physical, immersive structure, the installation gives a unique and thought-provoking look at
                    how race, culture, and materiality intersect.
                </p><br>
                <p>"Black Gooey Universe" forces us to consider race, culture, and materiality. The installation's
                    tactile, sensory materials and immersive structure encourage spectators to experience these
                    complicated concepts. Johnson's work inspires us to study our world's rich and complex history by
                    asking us to reflect on our bodies and experiences.
