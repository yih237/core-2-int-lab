        <p>As someone passionate about design, I am highly concerned about the impact of surveillance capitalism on our democratic systems. We must take steps to safeguard our democratic values in the era of digital technology. I am especially intrigued by how sharing knowledge, influence, and control can influence the development of our societies.</p>
        <br><p>Surveillance capitalism emerged in the early 2000s, giving internet giants access to personal data and creating an imbalance of power. Profit-driven algorithms disseminate distorted information, creating epistemic chaos and undermining democracy. To address this, we propose three tenets for the third decade: applying the democratic rule of law to the digital world, establishing new charters of epistemic rights, and considering unprecedented solutions like banning commercial data collection.</p>
        <br><p>This article highlights the need for joint efforts, political will, and reconsideration of the interplay between technology, capitalism, and democracy. It underlines the significant role that design plays in shaping the dissemination of information, creating user experiences, and upholding societal norms. It stresses our responsibility to promote transparency, accountability, and protection of democratic principles by designing digital interfaces, information systems, and communication tactics.</p>
        <br><p>As we navigate the third decade of the 21st century, we stand at a unique crossroads where we can shape a democratic digital civilization that mirrors our aspirations for a free society. This endeavor requires a multidisciplinary approach involving lawmakers, regulators, designers, technologists, and citizens. By prioritizing democratic values and curbing the power of surveillance capitalism, we can strive toward a future where democracy and technology coexist peacefully, cultivating a society that cherishes truth, transparency, and individual rights.</p>
