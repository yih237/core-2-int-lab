                <p>Alt-Text as Poetry is an online platform created by two disabled artists that focus on individuals with disabilities. The platform advocates for alternative ways of perceiving alt-text, which is critical for people with visual and cognitive impairments to engage with online materials meaningfully. However, the creators acknowledge that alt-text can be uncreative and uninteresting. Alt-Text as Poetry fosters a digital community committed to generating, exchanging, and amplifying disability media and culture while urging people to analyze technology's impact on society. The website offers complimentary resources and online content, including a workbook available in English and Spanish, which reimagines alt-text as a form of poetry and provides writing exercises. The authors' objective is not only to enable alt-text users to access visual content on the internet but also to create a sense of belonging for these individuals in digital spaces. Alt-Text as Poetry provides workshops for organizations and other groups and a blog showcasing examples of alt-text image descriptions.

                <p>"Alt Text as Poetry" is a remarkable project that showcases the connection between the visual and the textual. Traditionally used for practical purposes, alt text is transformed into a tool for evocative language and vibrant imagery on this website. This project encourages us to rethink the relationship between words and images, emphasizing their intrinsic bond and the ability of language to create emotional reactions.
                </p><br>
                <p>The website brings up significant inquiries regarding the very essence of poetry. Can poetry transcend its conventional structure? Is poetry delineated by its medium, or by its power to elicit emotions and stimulate contemplation? "Alt Text as Poetry" challenges the limits of these inquiries and presents a persuasive case for the innate flexibility and versatility of poetry.
