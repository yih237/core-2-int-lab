          The article's website is created entirely in HTML code and has a retro feel. The various aspects of the early
          web are presented in several parts, as well as the history and evolution of the early web. Some early web
          trends are reappearing in new ways, such as linking, although in the past, it was used to promote other web
          pages because the internet and the websites on it are still very young. People may visit more websites if
          there are more links to relevant and unrelated sites. It now takes the shape of forecasts generated by
          artificial intelligence and big data, which appear immediately after your previously viewed
          photo/video/item/article. Most of the components from the early web before the 2000s, such as the black outer
          space backdrops, colorful signs, under-construction signs, and so on, were created without the help of
          designers. When CSS3 and JavaScript were published in 1999 and 1995, visual components began to grow and
          develop in the 2000s. Designers sought to code websites utilizing these two languages with HTML to make
          websites more visually appealing. As the author of this post noted, the web ecosystem is becoming more
          organized and sophisticated. As a result, most of the old websites have become hidden and practically
          invisible or have been displayed as terrible examples of aesthetics. These early amateur websites were once
          dubbed "barbarians" but have now become a symbol of vintage aesthetics. However, I enjoyed looking at the
          nostalgic gifs, which reminded me of exploring the internet with my mom when I was younger and also
          demonstrated how quickly the internet has evolved in such a short period of time. </p>
