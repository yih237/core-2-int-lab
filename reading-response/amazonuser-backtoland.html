                <p>In "The Hidden Life of an Amazon User" by Joana Moll, the author goes into detail regarding how she bought a book through Amazon and then looked into how the code that runs behind the scenes affects the surroundings. Moll's research shows that the 12 methods used in the buying process have a lot of code—8,724 A4 pages' value, which is the same as 87.33MB of data. She says that the user is forced to pay for the around 30Wh of energy needed to load these interfaces and their code snippets. The piece shines a light on the hidden costs of online shopping and shows how the digital world needs sustainable and clear ways of doing things.
                </p><br>

                <p>Moll's story shows how aggressively internet companies take advantage of their users, since their business models depend on giving each user a personalized experience through displays which are neutral and appealing. These user interfaces hide complex business models inside a lot of hard-to-understand code that is triggered by the user's work. The methods employ a lot of energy, which the person using them has no choice but to pay for. In the end, the person is not only taken advantage of because they work for free, but they must additionally pay for the energy used for taking advantage of them? </p><br>

                <p>A question to be raised while reading this reading is: How can we improve consumer and corporate knowledge of the hidden environmental costs of internet buying and encourage more sustainable practices?
                    This reminds me of one of my ULECs about design and society. In order to answer this question, we must analyze the role of education and public awareness efforts in informing customers about the hidden environmental costs of online purchasing. This can be accomplished through a variety of avenues, including media, social networks, and educational institutions. Furthermore, non-governmental organizations and environmental organizations can play an important role in pushing for sustainable digital activities. Incentives, laws, and customer pressure can all be used to push corporations to adopt more sustainable practices.</p>

                <p>This case study, "The Internet's Back-to-the-Land Movement," examines the relationship between technology, environmental concerns, and alternative living. "The Limits to Growth," the 1972 Club of Rome report, warned of global resource depletion owing to exponential human growth. Environmentalists opposed the club's answers, believing a healthy society required a global order change. The back-to-the-land movement began in the early 1970s, with thousands living in communes and pursuing self-sufficiency. The "Whole Earth Catalog" and Masanobu Fukuoka's "The One-Straw Revolution" guided these alternative lifestyles. Online communities like the WELL promoted knowledge sharing and virtual equality in the 1980s, fostering digital utopianism. Corporate control and profit-driven goals replaced digital utopianism. The Internet consumes 10% of global electricity and has a huge environmental impact. The case study suggests that the internet's back-to-the-land trend may involve rethinking website use and hosting, using independent mesh networks, and developing small, localized online communities.

                </p><br>

                <p>This article reminds us of the risks of pursuing progress and technology. Our digital world contributes to resource depletion and environmental challenges, which is frightening. However, the article emphasizes innovation and community strength to establish alternatives to conventional systems. I was thinking while reading that rethinking website hosting and using autonomous mesh networks and localized online communities can be a challenge and an opportunity for us as students. How can we help create resource-efficient digital environments that prioritize human interactions and shared values? The article also intrigues me about technology's history and effects on society and the environment. Understanding past decisions and their repercussions can help construct a sustainable and fair digital future. This also links to my ULEC course. We can incorporate energy-efficient design principles into our work, such as streamlining web designs and make scripts easier, websites easier to load, to reduce data usage and energy consumption. In creating digital spaces, it's crucial to ensure that they are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities, socioeconomic background, or location. By designing with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, us as designers can help build online communities that are truly representative of our diverse global population.
