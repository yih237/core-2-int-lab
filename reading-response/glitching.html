                <p>The article "Glitching the Master’s House: Legacy Russell and Momtaza Mehri in Conversation" as presented by Frieze magazine, showcases an engaging dialogue between two current cultural critics, Legacy Russell and Momtaza Mehri. The main focus of the discussion is the book “Glitch Feminism: A Manifesto” which delves into the confluence of technology, feminism, and race. Throughout their conversation, Russell and Mehri delve into the idea of glitching as a means to interrupt and challenge the prevailing power structure, examining how it can be utilized to dismantle oppressive systems and carve out room for underrepresented views and voices. As a user of various technologies, including the internet and media, I understood the significance of acknowledging how technology influences our experiences and identities. It's easy for individuals to see how technology impacts their lives, as it shapes their experiences and identities through both online and offline interactions. Russell's assertion that embracing inherent glitches and errors in technology can lead to new avenues for connection and empowerment, prompted me to question the link between technology and potential in human experiences.
