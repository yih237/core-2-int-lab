          This reading provides a thought-provoking examination of the concept of function within the realm of design. Personally, I found the author's interpretation of function as a narrative to be particularly intriguing. The author's unique ability to perceive everyday objects not as static entities, but rather as storytellers presents an innovative perspective that I had not previously considered. This perspective is particularly relevant in today's digital age where physical objects tend to be overshadowed by their digital counterparts. Additionally, the author poses important questions regarding our understanding and interaction with objects in our environment. The thought that users might adapt objects for their purposes, resulting in unforeseen functional narratives, is truly fascinating. It challenges us to reconsider the limits of design, as well as the roles of the designer and the user. The author's project, which involved designing containers and examining the stories they tell, was captivating. The subsequent government actions that followed added an unexpected layer to the narrative of the author's design. Moreover, the author's use of common objects, such as umbrellas and jewelry, to create alternative narratives beyond their original function, resonates with the contemporary ideas of upcycling and sustainability. This notion entails the use of objects beyond their conventional lifespan and intended purpose. Overall, the author's reflective and inventive viewpoint on function encourages readers to delve beyond the surface of the objects surrounding us and appreciate the stories they tell. It serves as a reminder that design goes beyond aesthetics and utility, and also involves the narratives and experiences that objects can evoke.
