                <p>Laurel Schwurst's writing was an easy and pleasant read compared to the other readings but was still
                    informational. Schwulst uses different analogies and metaphors, showing the different ways that
                    different websites can grow. It also shows the diverse range of how a website can serve as both an
                    art form and a technological tool. She also reminded the audience that we should not be afraid of
                    the web and instead looked at it as somewhere where artists create. I like the analogy of the
                    garden, as sometimes websites burst out all of a sudden, like the autumn season, but sometimes the
                    gardener(designer) has to work on it for a long time to get a breakthrough, like in the winter.
                    Schwulst promoted us not to be afraid of the web and instead do anything we want, even making sites
                    like a rock thrown into the ocean or a rain puddle that dries after a bit. The web has unlimited
                    possibilities; she states, "the web is what you made of it." She also wanted us not to view the
                    internet as it is a common prevailing metaphor â€” a cloud. </p><br>
                <p>This article has drastically altered my perception of the internet. I always had a perception while
                    designing and coding that I was just "not good enough" before reading this article. There was a
                    category of "good" websites, and mine wasn't one of them. I always wanted more from the websites I
                    created. However, as Schwulst stated, a website can be unexpected, boring, subtle, or bold... And I
                    like the idea that websites are always unfinished. Websites are like art, they are always waiting
                    for users to complete them -- there's never a complete website, nor is there ever a complete piece
                    of art. </p><br>

                <p>After reading this article, I realized the importance of the relationship between creator and
                    audience and how accessibility, user experience, and maintenance are crucial to a website.</p>
