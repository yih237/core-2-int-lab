            <section> <p>Between the turn of the century and World War I, postcards became mass media of
                communication and collectible objects for the first time in French history.1 A significant
                portion of the millions of postcards produced yearly in France displayed Algerian
                tourist sites and ethnic types. During the 1980s, post-colonial scholarship set out to
                unmask the colonial agenda in these postcards by linking seemingly non-political
                Orientalist iconography to the French colonial project. Malek Alloula’s The Colonial
                Harem, the best-known of these revisionist texts, provides an important interpretation
                of the images, yet also demonstrates the shortcomings of an approach that focuses
                solely on Orientalist imagery.2 Alloula reproduces postcards of belly dancers and
                harem women (typical Orientalist iconography) and arranges the images into a narrative
                so that the models are progressively unveiled. Using metaphors of penetration
                and possession, he compares the unveiling of the women with the French colonial conquest
                of Algeria. By rearranging the cards in his book, however, Alloula fails to
                consider what personal arrangements of the images might have meant for those who
                collected them. Furthermore, he overgeneralizes the metaphor of sexual conquest and
                overly delimits both the audience for the cards and their meanings: penetration and
                possession imply that the viewers and collectors were heterosexual males. Rather than
                reduce the postcards to a monolithic masculine colonial imperative, as anti-Orientalist
                readings tend to do, we must investigate how the images functioned differently depending
                on the context of their use. This chapter seeks to uncover the layers of meaning the
                cards acquired as “views” and “types” were produced by the government-aided tourist
                industry and displayed by French collectionneuses.</p></section>
            <section><p>Colonial postcards had complex origins, which were emblematic of the complex motivations
                for their production and obscured by the cards’ cross-continental travel. Since
                1840, the French presence in the colony had relied on capitalist involvement in
                tourism. By the turn of the century, the French government was funding Neurdein
                Frères – ND Photographic Studio, one of the largest French postcard producers. The
                government used ND images for travel guides and historic records because tourism
                expanded the colonial infrastructure and postcard publicity stimulated private investment.
                ND covered Algeria extensively, with the number of Algerian images second only 
                to their representations of France.3 Like other Paris studios, ND studios sent photographers
    to the colonies to take pictures.4 ND processed and edited the images in Paris,
    and then marketed them to businesses in Algeria. Because the postcards were bought,
    sold, and postmarked in Algeria, the role the French company took in their production
    was suppressed; the cards were understood by the French to originate from the colony
    and to reflect the sensibilities of the indigenous population.
