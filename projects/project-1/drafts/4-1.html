          In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of
          endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings
          that we cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem
          is abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind,
          which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end.

          Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that no poem is ever
          ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also
          attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a
          cloud.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and
          to my mind so accurately, that I have never forgotten it: the opening
          line of a poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece
          of fallen fruit you have never seen before, and the poet's task is to
          create the tree from which such a fruit would fall.
