    <P>In life, the <A color="white" href="1.html"> number of beginnings</A> is exactly equal to the <A
            href="/core-2-int-lab/projects/project-1/drafts/1.html">number of endings</A>: <a
            href="/core-2-int-lab/projects/project-1/drafts/1.html">no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it.

    <P>In poetry, the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we cannot even conceive of it. 
        <a href="/core-2-int-lab/projects/project-1/drafts/1.html" >
            Not every poem is finished—one poem is abandoned,
            another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem
            without an end.
        </a>

    <P>Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that 
        <a href="/core-2-int-lab/projects/project-1/drafts/1.html">
            no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned. This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where quotations begin is in a cloud.
