                    Lynn Kiang spoke about her design work, precisely her approach to projects and processes. Clients'
                    needs and concerns are important to her, as well as trust and collaboration. She stressed the
                    importance of understanding the context of the project, including the space it will occupy, the
                    audience it will reach, and the story it will tell. To find the best solution, she emphasized asking
                    questions, doing research, and experimenting.

                    In addition, Lynn talked about how she found work through word-of-mouth and building relationships
                    with clients. The protest posters she created in response to the 2016 presidential election garnered
                    a significant comeback and emphasized the power of design.

                    She also discussed her project with the Museum of the City of New York, a 100th-anniversary
                    exhibition. The exhibition will feature interactive media pieces telling the New York City story.
                    Lynn and her team use various media, including projections, sound, and books.

                    Aspiring designers can learn a lot from Lin Kiang's lecture. One key takeaway is the importance of
                    trust in building solid relationships with clients and collaborators. Lin stressed the importance of
                    word-of-mouth recommendations and building a solid reputation. Additionally, Lin's poster design for
                    the Women's March demonstrated the power of design for activism. Adaptability is another key
                    takeaway, such as navigating exhibit space constraints or responding to unexpected political
                    conditions. Lin's focus on low-fi, rapid-response design approaches offers a reminder that effective
                    design doesn't always require a large team or the latest technology but rather a thoughtful and
                    strategic approach. Lin notes that "it doesn't take many people to do complex stuff. You just need
                    the right people." Another quote that stood out was, "Design at its most fundamental is there to
                    communicate." This highlights the importance of design in giving people a voice and telling stories
                    that need to be heard.
