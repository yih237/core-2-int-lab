                <p> 
                    During David Jonathan Ross's lecture, he delved into the history of typefaces and how they have developed over time
                    to become what they are today. He noted that while website design has expanded, font loading
                    limitations have caused many fonts to be invisible before they load on a website. Ross introduced a
                    new CSS property called {font-display: swap}, which replaces fonts with system fonts before variable
                    fonts were introduced.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Variable fonts are unique because only one outline is stored, and their differences are swapped. The
                    differences are described as an axis, and when the two sets of points of a variable font are mapped,
                    any variant in the axis can be modified, and a new font will be generated. Ross highlighted that "if
                    you use more than one typeface variant, a variable font may save you some kilobytes."
                </p>
                <p> 
                    One of the key benefits of variable fonts is that they provide the type user with greater control
                    over how the type works. Additionally, the type designer can bake in some recommendations on how and
                    where certain variations can be used. Type designers have gradually started to think about a
                    multi-dimensional design space while approaching their design and have interpolation software.

                <p> 
                    Ross also mentioned input.fontbureau.com, a site where designers and coders can customize their
                    coding environment by changing the text's width, height, and line height. They can even adjust the
                    zeroes and brackets. Once finished, they can download their customized font. The concept of
                    "tweak-ability" is critical, as it allows for greater flexibility and customization in design.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    In conclusion, Ross's lecture provided insights into the development of typefaces and the importance
                    of variable fonts. The ability to manipulate the axis and create new fonts allows for greater
                    control and flexibility in design. The incorporation of "tweak-ability" ensures that designers and
                    coders can customize their designs to fit their unique needs.
