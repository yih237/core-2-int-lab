                    The lecture explored the importance of celebrating cultural identities in design and the challenges
                    designers face in a white-centric industry. Elaine Lopez emphasized broadening perspectives,
                    challenging norms, and telling new stories to create a more inclusive and equitable design field.
                    Her presentation included examples of Lopez's work, including projects that centered on the cultural
                    identities of her clients and her own.

                    Hung Liu, a Chinese-American artist, was the subject of one of her most notable projects. With equal
                    emphasis on Chinese and English text, Lopez's exhibition design was intentionally bilingual. This
                    design choice encourages visitors to engage with both languages equally to honor Liu's identity as
                    an American and Chinese artist. An additional project Lopez shared was a workshop featuring
                    Philadelphia-based activists designed to provide guidance and support to students on college
                    campuses.

                    Regardless of designers' challenges in creating culturally relevant work within a homogenous
                    industry, Lopez stressed the importance of reconnecting with one's culture through design. In
                    addition, it is challenging to balance personal priorities with corporate constraints, such as
                    cultural identity and activism. Aside from self-publishing, she suggested designers find other
                    passion projects to satisfy their creative urges. Ultimately, Lopez's lecture offered designers an
                    inspiring call to action to use their skills to celebrate cultural identities and push for an
                    inclusive, equitable design industry. In the lecture, the most inspiring sentence was, "let's
                    broaden perspectives, interrogate our values, challenge norms, tell new stories, and share them with
                    the world.‚Äù
