                <p>
                    Pascal Glissmann's lecture was incredibly inspirational and thought-provoking for me. In
                    addition to being creative, Glissmann emphasizes the importance of community and observation in
                    design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Glissmann presented several of his recent design projects that focus on observation. The Atlas of
                    Everyday Objects documents everyday objects during the pandemic, the Global Experiment on Looking at
                    Water, invites people to observe and document water in their local environments, and the Typographic
                    Matchmaking Project, brings together designers from diverse cultures to design typefaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, I was interested in his Atlas of Looking at Water, which encourages people to observe
                    and document water in their environment. Along with other projects he presented, this project showed
                    me how design can be used to engage people in social and environmental issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Glissmann's emphasis on community building resonated with me as well. Relationships between
                    designers, collaborators, and stakeholders are essential for a successful project, he said. The
                    focus on community and collaboration reminded me that design isn't just about aesthetics or
                    problem-solving; it's about creating relationships.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In summary, Glissmann's presentation reminded me that design can contribute to social and
                    environmental change. Furthermore, I became more aware of the importance of community and
                    observation in my own design practice.
